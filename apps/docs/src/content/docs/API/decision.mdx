## Introduction

The `Decision` class is where everything comes together. It acts as the final evaluation point for access control. Once all the necessary elements—guards, policies, and the representative—are prepared, the `Decision` object performs the actual access check.

With `Decision`, you can:

    - Check if a Representative has access to a specific action on an entity.
    - Evaluate synchronous (`can()`) or asynchronous (`could()`) guards and restrictions.
    - Access additional metadata like whether the policy or action exists and the overall conclusion of the access evaluation.

## Core Concepts

    ### Unified Evaluation:
        - Combines all the necessary components (guards, policies, representative, and entity) to perform the access check.

    ### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Checks:
        - can(): Evaluates synchronous guards and restrictions.
        - could(): Includes asynchronous guards in the evaluation.

    ### Additional Metadata:
        #### Provides useful flags like:
            - Whether a policy exists.
            - Whether the action exists within the policy.
            - Whether a global or policy guard provided a definitive decision.
        #### Use conclusion to fetch the final decision after the `can()` or `could()` evaluation.

    ### Lazy Guards:
        - Lazy guards (`sync` and `async`) are evaluated during the `can()` and `could()` calls. This allows for dynamic, runtime access decisions.

## Creating a `Decision`

A `Decision` object is typically created internally when you call `access()` or `asyncAccess()` on a Representative.

```ts
const representative = gate.build({ id: 1 });
const decision = representative.access("user", "update");
```

## Using the Decision API

    1. Check Access with `can()`: Perform a synchronous access check:
    ```ts
    console.log(decision.can({ id: 1 })); // true or false
    ```
    2. Check Access with `could()`: Perform an asynchronous access check (includes async guards):
    ```ts
    console.log(await decision.could({ id: 1 })); // true or false
    ```
    3. Access Metadata: Use flags and getters to retrieve additional information about the decision:
    ```ts
    console.log(decision.hasPolicy); // true (if the policy exists)
    console.log(decision.hasAction); // true (if the action exists in the policy)
    console.log(decision.isGuardDecision); // true (if guards provided a definitive decision)
    console.log(decision.conclusion); // true or false (final decision after evaluation)
    ```
## Detailed Example
```ts
import { Gate, Policy } from "access-gate";

// Define policies
const userPolicy = new Policy("user");
userPolicy.define("update", (rep, user) => rep.id === user.id); // Users can update their own data
userPolicy.guard((rep) => (rep.isActive ? undefined : false)); // Inactive users cannot access

const gate = new Gate();
gate.addPolicy(userPolicy);

// Build a representative
const representative = gate.build({ id: 1, isActive: true });

// Access evaluation
const decision = representative.access("user", "update");

// Perform checks
console.log(decision.can({ id: 1 })); // true (user can update their own data)
console.log(decision.can({ id: 2 })); // false (user cannot update others' data)

// Check metadata
console.log(decision.hasPolicy); // true
console.log(decision.hasAction); // true
console.log(decision.isGuardDecision); // false (guards did not provide a definitive decision)
console.log(decision.conclusion); // true (final decision after evaluation)
```

## Decision Evaluation Flow

    ### Global Guard Decision:
        - If a definitive decision (true or false) is made by a global guard, it overrides all other checks.

    ### Policy Guards:
        - Policy-specific guards are evaluated next during access() or asyncAccess().

    ### Lazy Guards:
        - Evaluated dynamically during can() or could() calls.
        - Includes both global and policy-specific lazy guards.

    ### Restrictions:
        - If no definitive decision is made by guards, restrictions are applied based on the defined rules for the action.

### Key Properties and Methods

    1. `can(entity)`:
        - Evaluates synchronous guards and restrictions for the given entity.
        - Returns a boolean (`true` or `false`).

    2. `could(entity)`:
        - Evaluates both synchronous and asynchronous guards for the given entity.
        - Returns a `Promise<boolean>`.

    3. `conclusion`:
        - Provides the final decision after `can()` or `could()` is called.
        - Reflects the overall result of the evaluation.

    4. `hasPolicy`:
        - Indicates whether the policy exists for the evaluated action.

    5. `hasAction`:
        - Indicates whether the action exists within the evaluated policy.

    6. `isGuardDecision`:
        - Indicates whether the decision was made solely by a guard.
