## Introduction

A guard in **_access-gate_** serves two primary responsibilities:

    1. Providing a Decision:
        - Guards can either allow, deny, or remain undecided about an action.
    2. Providing Dependencies:
        - Guards can inject dependencies that are accessible during access evaluation.

Guards are a powerful mechanism for implementing dynamic, context-aware access control logic.
## Core Concepts

    ### Order Matters:
        - Guards are executed in the order they are added.
        - As soon as a guard provides a definitive decision (`true` or `false`), execution stops, and the decision becomes final.

    ### Sync vs. Async Guards:
        - Synchronous guards are applied first.
        - If no decision is reached, asynchronous guards are executed.

    ### Global vs. Lazy Guards:
        #### Global Guards:
            - Added at the Gate level.
            - Applied during the `build()` or` buildAsync()` method execution.
        #### Lazy Guards:
            - Evaluated during every `can()` or `could()` method call.
            - Includes both `lazyGuards` and `asyncLazyGuards`.

    ### Guard Execution Flow:
        #### During `build()`:
            - Only global guards (sync and async) are evaluated.
        #### During `can()` or `could()`:
            - Lazy guards execute in the following order:
                1. Global `Gate` lazy guards.
                2. `Policy`-specific lazy guards.
                3. Global and policy-specific async lazy guards (only in `could()`).

    ### Policy-Specific Guards:
        - Guards can be attached to a specific `Policy`.
        - These are executed during `access()` or `asyncAccess()` calls on the Representative.
        - Policy lazy guards are merged with the global Gate lazy guards for evaluation in `can()` and `could()`.

## Using Guards

### Global Guards

Add guards at the Gate level:

```ts
const gate = new Gate();

gate.guard((representative) => {
  if (representative.isAdmin) return true; // Grant access
  return undefined; // No decision
});

gate.asyncGuard(async (representative) => {
  if (!representative.isActive) return false; // Deny access
  return undefined; // No decision
});
```

### Lazy Guards

Lazy guards are evaluated during `can()` and `could()` calls:

```ts
gate.lazyGuard((representative, entity) => {
  if (entity.status === "draft") return false; // Deny access to drafts
  return undefined; // No decision
});

gate.asyncLazyGuard(async (representative, entity) => {
  const isVerified = await checkVerificationStatus(representative.id);
  return isVerified ? undefined : false; // Deny if not verified
});
```
### Policy-Specific Guards

Attach guards to specific policies:

```ts
const userPolicy = new Policy("user");

userPolicy.guard((representative) => {
  if (representative.role === "editor") return true;
  return undefined;
});

userPolicy.lazyGuard((representative, entity) => {
  return representative.id === entity.ownerId ? true : undefined;
});

userPolicy.asyncLazyGuard(async (representative, entity) => {
  const isTrusted = await isTrustedUser(representative.id);
  return isTrusted ? undefined : false;
});
```

## Guard Evaluation Example
```ts
const representative = { id: 1, role: "admin", isActive: true };
const post = { id: 101, status: "published", ownerId: 1 };

const gate = new Gate();
const postPolicy = new Policy("post");

postPolicy.lazyGuard((rep, entity) => entity.ownerId === rep.id);

gate.addPolicy(postPolicy);
gate.lazyGuard((rep) => (rep.role === "guest" ? false : undefined));

// Build the representative
const rep = gate.build(representative);

// Access evaluation
const access = rep.access("post", "view");

// Sync evaluation
console.log(access.can(post)); // true

// Async evaluation
console.log(await access.could(post)); // true
```

## API

### Guard
```ts
Guard<T = unknown, D = unknown> = (
    representative: T,
    provide: (name: string, dependency: D) => void
  ) => boolean | undefined;
```

### LazyGuard
```ts
LazyGuard<T = unknown, E = unknown, D = unknown> = (
  representative: T,
  entity: E,
  provide: (name: string, dependency: D) => void
) => boolean | undefined;
```

### AsyncGuard
```ts
AsyncGuard<T = unknown, D = unknown> = (
  representative: T,
  provide: (name: string, dependency: D) => void
) => Promise<boolean | undefined>;
```

### AsyncLazyGuard
```ts
AsyncLazyGuard<T = unknown, E = unknown, D = unknown> = (
  representative: T,
  entity: E,
  provide: (name: string, dependency: D) => void
) => Promise<boolean | undefined>;
```
