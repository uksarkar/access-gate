title: Representative
---
## Introduction

A Representative is the instance of your application's `Gate` rules, prepared to evaluate access for a specific entity. It represents a context-aware object that interacts with the `Gate`, policies, and guards to determine access permissions in real-time.

The Representative enables detailed and isolated access evaluations for specific users, systems, or entities against the policies and rules defined in the `Gate`.
## Core Concepts

    ### 1. Instance of Rules and Policies:
        - A Representative is created using the `Gate`, binding the rules, guards, and policies to a specific entity.
        - This allows targeted access checks for individual entities, such as users or systems.

    ### 2. Prepared Access Evaluation:
        - The Representative consolidates and optimizes guard and policy evaluation for the entity it represents.

    ### 3. Real-Time Decision Making:
        - Access checks can be performed synchronously (`can()`) or asynchronously (`could()`).
        - Guards and restrictions are evaluated in sequence, with the first definitive decision (`true` or `false`) halting further checks.

    ### 4. Policy-Specific Access:
        - The Representative interacts with the `Gate` to evaluate policy-level guards and restrictions for the entity.

    ### 5. Global Guard Preprocessing:
        - When the Representative is created, global guards are evaluated to establish a baseline decision for the entity.

## Creating a Representative

To create a Representative, you use the `Gate`'s `build()` or `buildAsync()` methods, passing in the entity to be evaluated.
```ts
import { Gate } from "access-gate";

const gate = new Gate();

// Add global guards
gate.guard((rep) => (rep.isBanned ? false : undefined));

// Build a Representative for a specific user
const representative = gate.build({ id: 1, isBanned: false });

// The Representative is now ready for access evaluations
```
## Evaluating Access
### Access a Policy

Evaluate synchronous guards and restrictions for a specific action within a policy:
```ts
const access = representative.access("user", "update");
console.log(access.can({ id: 1 })); // true or false
```

### Async Access Evaluation

Include asynchronous guards in the evaluation:
```ts
const asyncAccess = await representative.asyncAccess("user", "update");
console.log(await asyncAccess.could({ id: 1 })); // true or false
```

## Detailed Example
```ts
import { Gate, Policy } from "access-gate";

// Define policies
const userPolicy = new Policy("user");
userPolicy.define("update", (rep, user) => rep.id === user.id); // Users can update their own data
userPolicy.guard((rep) => (rep.isAdmin ? undefined : false)); // Admins are prioritized

// Add the policy to the Gate
const gate = new Gate();
gate.addPolicy(userPolicy);

// Build Representatives for specific users
const admin = gate.build({ id: 1, isAdmin: true, isBanned: false });
const regularUser = gate.build({ id: 2, isAdmin: false, isBanned: false });
const bannedUser = gate.build({ id: 3, isAdmin: false, isBanned: true });

// Evaluate access for an admin
const adminAccess = admin.access("user", "update");
console.log(adminAccess.can({ id: 2 })); // true (admins can update any user)

// Evaluate access for a regular user
const userAccess = regularUser.access("user", "update");
console.log(userAccess.can({ id: 2 })); // true (can update their own data)
console.log(userAccess.can({ id: 3 })); // false (cannot update others' data)

// Evaluate access for a banned user
const bannedAccess = bannedUser.access("user", "update");
console.log(bannedAccess.can({ id: 3 })); // false (banned users cannot access)
```

## Guard Evaluation Flow

    1. During Representative Creation (`build` or `buildAsync`):
        - Global guards are evaluated immediately.
        - If a definitive decision is reached, it applies universally across all policies.

    2. During Policy Access (access or asyncAccess):
        - Policy-specific guards are evaluated.
        - Lazy guards (global and policy-specific) are merged and executed during `can()` or `could()` calls:
            1. Global lazy guards.
            2. Policy-specific lazy guards.
            3. Global async lazy guards.
            4. Policy-specific async lazy guards.

## Next Steps

Explore how the Representative interacts with other components:

    - [Gate](/access-gate/api/gate): The centralized structure for managing guards and policies.
    - [Policy](/access-gate/api/policy): Group entity-specific access controls with restrictions and guards.
    - [Decision](/access-gate/api/decision): The final result of access evaluations.
