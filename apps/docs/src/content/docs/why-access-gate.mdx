title: Why access-gate?
hide_breadcrumbs: true
---

When building modern applications, implementing role-based access control (RBAC) and managing permissions can become complex, especially when handling scenarios like:

    - Defining granular access rules for various entities (e.g., posts, videos).
    - Applying global or contextual restrictions (e.g., admin-only actions).
    - Supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
    - Maintaining clean, reusable, and testable code for permission management.

`access-gate` addresses these challenges with a powerful yet flexible approach, offering:

## Key Advantages

    - ### Granular Policies:
        - Define fine-tuned access rules for specific actions on resources.

        ```ts
        const postPolicy = new Policy("post");
        postPolicy.define("update", (user, post) => user.id === post.authorId);
        ```
    - ### Guards for Contextual Control:
        - Apply global or entity-specific restrictions effortlessly.
        ```ts
        gate.guard((user) => user.isAdmin); // Global guard
        gate.lazyGuard((user, post) => user.id === post.authorId); // Lazy guard
        ```
    - ### Support for Async Logic:
        - Handle asynchronous operations like database lookups or API calls with asyncLazyGuard.
        ```ts
        gate.asyncLazyGuard(async (user, post) => {
            const isOwner = await checkOwnership(user.id, post.id);
            return isOwner;
        });
        ```
    - ### Lightweight & Performant:
        - Built with a focus on speed and simplicity, leveraging modern JavaScript/TypeScript features.

    - ### Flexible API:
        - Intuitive and type-safe API for effortless integration into any JavaScript or TypeScript project.

    - ### Advanced Features:
        - Dependency injection for guards.
        - Comprehensive TypeScript typings.

## When Should You Use `access-gate`?
    - Multi-role Applications: Applications with users in roles like admin, editor, or viewer.
    - Granular Permissions: When actions require fine-grained control (e.g., a user can edit their own posts but not others).
    - Asynchronous Decision Making: Use cases where access decisions rely on external APIs or databases.

## When Shouldn't You Use It?
    - If you only need very basic RBAC without guards or policies.
    - If you're building a small app with no complex permission requirements.
