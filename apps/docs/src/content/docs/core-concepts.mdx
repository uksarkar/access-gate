To effectively use **_access-gate_**, itâ€™s essential to understand the core building blocks of the library. These concepts work together to provide a robust and flexible role-based access control (RBAC) system.

 ## 1. Gate

The Gate is the central hub that manages policies and guards. It acts as a container for all access control rules.

### Key Responsibilities
    - Store and manage policies.
    - Register and evaluate guards.
    - Create Representative instances to evaluate decisions.

**Example**
```ts
import { Gate } from "access-gate";

const gate = new Gate();

// Add policies and guards to the gate
gate.addPolicy(postPolicy);
gate.guard((user) => user.isAdmin);
```

## 2. Policies

A Policy defines a set of rules (or actions) for a specific resource. Each action in a policy represents an operation that can be performed, such as "view", "update", or "delete".

### Key Methods
    - `define(action: string, fn: (user, entity) => boolean)`: Defines a rule for an action.
    - `can(action: string)`: Evaluates if an action is permitted.

**Example**
```ts
import { Policy } from "access-gate";

// Define a policy for posts
const postPolicy = new Policy("post");

// Define rules for actions
postPolicy.define("view", () => true); // Anyone can view
postPolicy.define("update", (user, post) => user.id === post.authorId); // Only the owner can update
```
## 3. Guards

Guards enforce global or contextual restrictions. They work alongside policies to add an extra layer of access control.
### Types of Guards
    - **Global Guards**: Applied to all actions and entities globally and have access only to the **representative**.
    ```ts
    gate.guard((user) => user.isAdmin);
    ```
    - **Lazy Guards**: Applied to specific entities during the call of `can()` method, and have access to **representative** and the **entity**.
    ```ts
    gate.lazyGuard((user, post) => user.id === post.authorId);
    ```

### Async Guards
Guards can also handle asynchronous logic, it's similar to the global guards.

<Callout variant="warning" title="Caution!">
Async guards should use with async builder otherwise it'll not be respected, see API reference section for more details.
</Callout>

```ts
gate.asyncLazyGuard(async (user, post) => {
  const isOwner = await checkOwnership(user.id, post.id);
  return isOwner;
});

// build the gate using async builder
const representative = await gate.asyncBuild();
```

## 4. Decisions

A Decision object represents the result of evaluating policies and guards. It allows you to check whether an action is permitted.

### Key Methods

    `can()`: Evaluates a synchronous decision.
    `could()`: Evaluates an asynchronous decision.

**Example**
```ts
const decision = representative.access("post", "update").can({ authorId: 1 });
console.log(decision); // true or false

const asyncDecision = await representative
  .access("post", "update")
  .could({ authorId: 2 });
console.log(asyncDecision); // true or false
```

## 5. Representative

A **_Representative_** evaluates decisions for a specific `user`. It uses `policies` and `guards` registered in the `Gate`.

**Example**
```ts
const representative = gate.build({ id: 1, role: "user" });

const decision = representative.access("post", "view").can();
console.log(decision); // true or false based on policies and guards
```

## How These Concepts Work Together
    - Define **_Policies_** for resources and actions.
    - Register **_Guards_** for global or entity-specific restrictions.
    - Use the **_Gate_** to manage policies and guards.
    - Create a **_Representative_** for the current user.
    - Evaluate **_Decisions_** to check access.
