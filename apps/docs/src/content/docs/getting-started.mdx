**_access-gate_** makes it easy to define, manage, and evaluate role-based access control (RBAC) in your applications. Follow these steps to get started:

## Installation

Install the library via npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install access-gate
# or
yarn add access-gate
```

## Basic Usage
To start using **_access-gate_**, you need to create a Gate instance, define policies, and evaluate decisions.
```ts
import { Gate, Policy } from "access-gate";

// Create a new Gate instance
const gate = new Gate();

// Define a policy for managing posts
const postPolicy = new Policy("post");
postPolicy.define("update", (user, post) => user.id === post.authorId);

// Add the policy to the Gate
gate.addPolicy(postPolicy);

// Create a representative for the current user
const representative = gate.build({ id: 1 });

// Check if the user can update the post
const decision = representative.access("post", "update").can({ authorId: 1 });
console.log(decision); // true
```
