**_access-gate_** makes it easy to define, manage, and evaluate role-based access control (RBAC) in your applications. Follow these steps to get started:

## Installation

Install the library via npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install access-gate
# or
yarn add access-gate
```

## Basic Usage
<Callout variant="warning" title="Caution!">
This package is currently in beta. Its API is subject to frequent changes, which may introduce breaking updates. Proceed with caution and consider potential future updates before integrating it into production systems.
</Callout>
To start using **_access-gate_**, you need to create a Gate instance, define policies, and evaluate decisions.
```ts
import { Gate, Policy } from "access-gate";

// Create a new Gate instance
const gate = new Gate();

// Define a policy for managing posts
const postPolicy = new Policy("post");
postPolicy.define("update", (user, post) => user.id === post.authorId);

// Add the policy to the Gate
gate.addPolicy(postPolicy);

// Create a representative for the current user
const representative = gate.build({ id: 1 });

// Check if the user can update the post
const decision = representative.access("post", "update").can({ authorId: 1 });
console.log(decision); // true
```
